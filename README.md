ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aranyac

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the Amrut Mody School of Management at Ahmedabad University. I received my PhD in Economics from McGill University in 2023. 

My research interests lie in the areas of Development Economics, Information Economics, and Applied Microeconomics. More specifically, I study the adoption of risk management and mitigation strategies in developing countries, focusing primarily on the role of networks, social learning, and learning from experience.
